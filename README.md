# ThermoBlast
Instead of cooling or heating an entire room or building, this prototype promotes a personal wearable cooling/heating device, aiming to reduce the overall power consumption while increasing personal comfort. It's based on the perception of thermal comfort; heating or cooling a certain region in the body can affect he whole body by several degrees.
